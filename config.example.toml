# Example TOML configuration file for the Economic Simulation Framework
#
# Usage: ./target/release/simulation-framework --config config.toml
#
# Note: CLI arguments will override values specified in this file.
# For example: ./target/release/simulation-framework --config config.toml --steps 2000
# will use 2000 steps instead of the value below.

# Number of simulation steps to run
max_steps = 500

# Number of persons in the simulation (each will have one unique skill)
entity_count = 100

# Random seed for reproducibility
# Use the same seed to get identical simulation results
seed = 42

# Initial amount of money each person starts with
initial_money_per_person = 100.0

# Base price for all skills at simulation start
base_skill_price = 10.0

# Minimum price floor for skills
# Prevents skill prices from dropping below this threshold
# Models real-world price floors like minimum wages or regulatory price controls
# Must be positive and less than or equal to base_skill_price
# Default: 1.0
min_skill_price = 1.0

# Time step (for discrete turn-based simulation)
# This represents one discrete step or turn
time_step = 1.0

# Scenario type - determines price update mechanism
# Options:
#   - "Original": Supply/demand-based pricing with volatility
#   - "DynamicPricing": Sales-based pricing (increase if sold, decrease if not)
scenario = "Original"

# Technology growth rate per simulation step
# This simulates productivity improvements over time
# A rate of 0.001 means skills improve by 0.1% per step
# Set to 0.0 to disable technological progress (default)
tech_growth_rate = 0.0

# Transaction fee rate as a percentage of transaction value
# Fee is deducted from seller's proceeds on each transaction
# A value of 0.05 means a 5% fee is charged on each transaction
# Set to 0.0 to disable transaction fees (default)
# Valid range: 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)
transaction_fee = 0.0

# Example configurations for different use cases:

# Small economy for quick testing:
# max_steps = 100
# entity_count = 20
# seed = 123

# Large economy for detailed analysis:
# max_steps = 2000
# entity_count = 500
# initial_money_per_person = 200.0

# Crisis scenario (low initial money):
# max_steps = 1000
# entity_count = 100
# initial_money_per_person = 50.0
# base_skill_price = 20.0

# Dynamic pricing experiment:
# scenario = "DynamicPricing"
# max_steps = 1000
# base_skill_price = 15.0
