# Example YAML configuration file for the Economic Simulation Framework
#
# Usage: ./target/release/simulation-framework --config config.yaml
#
# Note: CLI arguments will override values specified in this file.
# For example: ./target/release/simulation-framework --config config.yaml --steps 2000
# will use 2000 steps instead of the value below.

# Number of simulation steps to run
max_steps: 500

# Number of persons in the simulation (each will have one unique skill)
entity_count: 100

# Random seed for reproducibility
# Use the same seed to get identical simulation results
seed: 42

# Initial amount of money each person starts with
initial_money_per_person: 100.0

# Base price for all skills at simulation start
base_skill_price: 10.0

# Time step (for discrete turn-based simulation)
# This represents one discrete step or turn
time_step: 1.0

# Scenario type - determines price update mechanism
# Options:
#   - Original: Supply/demand-based pricing with volatility
#   - DynamicPricing: Sales-based pricing (increase if sold, decrease if not)
scenario: Original

# Technology growth rate per simulation step
# This simulates productivity improvements over time
# A rate of 0.001 means skills improve by 0.1% per step
# Set to 0.0 to disable technological progress (default)
tech_growth_rate: 0.0

# Example configurations for different use cases:

# Small economy for quick testing:
# max_steps: 100
# entity_count: 20
# seed: 123

# Large economy for detailed analysis:
# max_steps: 2000
# entity_count: 500
# initial_money_per_person: 200.0

# Crisis scenario (low initial money):
# max_steps: 1000
# entity_count: 100
# initial_money_per_person: 50.0
# base_skill_price: 20.0

# Dynamic pricing experiment:
# scenario: DynamicPricing
# max_steps: 1000
# base_skill_price: 15.0
