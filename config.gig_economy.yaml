# Gig Economy Simulation Configuration
# This preset simulates a platform-based economy (like Uber, Fiverr, TaskRabbit)
# with workers, platform fees, ratings, and dynamic pricing (surge pricing)

# Simulation parameters
max_steps: 1000
entity_count: 200  # Larger workforce for realistic gig market
seed: 42
initial_money_per_person: 100.0
base_skill_price: 15.0

# Pricing scenario - DynamicPricing simulates surge pricing
scenario: DynamicPricing
price_elasticity_factor: 0.12  # Responsive to demand changes
volatility_percentage: 0.03    # Moderate price volatility

# Platform fees (15% commission is typical for gig platforms)
transaction_fee: 0.15  # 15% platform commission on each transaction

# Quality/Reputation system (critical for platform trust)
enable_quality: true
initial_quality: 3.0  # Starting quality rating (scale: 0.0-5.0)
quality_improvement_rate: 0.15  # Fast improvement through practice
quality_decay_rate: 0.03  # Slower decay (skills maintained)

# Short-term gig contracts
enable_contracts: true
min_contract_duration: 5   # Short gigs (5-20 simulation steps)
max_contract_duration: 20
contract_price_discount: 0.05  # 5% discount for contracted work

# Networking and repeat customers
enable_friendships: true
friendship_probability: 0.2  # 20% chance after successful trade (platform facilitates connections)
